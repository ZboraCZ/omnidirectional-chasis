# TODO list in the lab
* Take photo of RPi and Arduino for Thesis.
* Take photo of complete chasis build for Thesis.
* Test of response scripts from Arduino back to Raspberry Pi (new waiting method in RPi script)
* Test all Instruction primitives
* Build Up the chasis
* Take video of the chasis moving
* LETS ROLL!

# Bachelor thesis: Design and control of omnidirectional chasis.

## Running Raspberry Pi Shell scripts manual
### go.sh [int degrees] [int speedLevel]
int degrees: 째 from 0 to 360 defining the way chasis will go. 0째 is right, 90째 is front.
int speedLevel: Number from 1 to 16 defining how quickly will the motors rotate up to 200 steps per second.

### rotate.sh [int degrees] [int direction]
int degrees: 째 from 0 to 360 defining how much will the chasis rotate.
int direction: Number 0 or 1. 0 is rotation left(anticlockwise), 1 is rotation right(clockwise)

### brake.sh
Doesn't take arguments. Holds the motors still.

### stop.sh
Doesn't take arguments. Disables powering of the motors.

### setSpeed.sh [int speedLevel]
int speedLevel: Number from 1 to 16 defining how quickly will the motors rotate up to 200 steps per second.
Just sets speed of motors. Doesn't move anything.

## Checking I2C connection addresses table on Raspberry Pi:
sudo i2cdetect -y 1



# Maybe for future controlling with PS4 Dualshock Controller device
Scripts in the folder "ZZZ_unused_Controlling_motors_PS4_controller"
Workflow to start control of the Raspberry Pi:
1. sudo ds4drv, then start controller //Dualshock 4 controller will connect
2. start Main.py to start controlling
