# TODO list in the lab
* Take photo of RPi and Arduino for Thesis.
* Take photo of complete chasis build for Thesis.
* Test of response scripts from Arduino back to Raspberry Pi (new waiting method in RPi script)
* Make Enable/disable pins on motors Brake or Stop instruction

# Bachelor thesis: Design and control of omnidirectional chasis.

## Checking I2C connection addresses table on Raspberry Pi:
sudo i2cdetect -y 1



## Maybe for future controlling with PS4 Dualshock Controller device
Workflow to start control of the Raspberry Pi:
1. sudo ds4drv, then start controller //Dualshock 4 controller will connect
2. start Main.py to start controlling
